// 📖 Node.js Background
// 2009 – Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js
// 👉 It is based on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine
// 2010 – npm was added for managing external libraries
// 2011–2014 – Node.js gained attention for real-time solutions
// 2015 – The Node.js Foundation was created
// 2019–Now – Node.js is commonly used for servers, APIs, and full-stack development


// ********** Reason Behind Node.js **********

// Earlier server technologies were slow
// because they handled requests one by one.
// Node.js changed this by using:
// Asynchronous execution
// Event-driven model
// Non-blocking input/output


// ⭐ Benefits of Node.js

// 1️⃣ Very Fast
// Uses the V8 engine
// Executes JavaScript quickly

// 2️⃣ Handles Multiple Tasks
// Does not block other requests
// Processes many users at the same time

// 3️⃣ Same Language Everywhere
// JavaScript for client and server
// Easy for web developers

// 4️⃣ Rich Package System
// npm has a large number of libraries
// Saves time and effort

// 5️⃣ Great for Live Applications
// Chat systems
// Real-time alerts
// Online multiplayer games

// 6️⃣ Easy to Scale
// Works well for large systems
// Used by popular companies


// 📌 Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript
// Released in 2009 to build fast,
// scalable, and non-blocking backend applications.
